# APTrack

Objective - To make a system which tracks the air pollution produced by a vehicle and store its details into a database for further study and intimate
            users about the emissions from their vehicle through a mobile application.

Overview:   To make a system which tracks the air pollution produced by a vehicle which is coupled with a mobile application.
            Exhaust gases emitted by a vehicle will be sensed through a sensor namely MQ7, MQ135.
            This sensor then, will be coupled with a Bluetooth module which sends the analysis data to the mobile app.  
            The cars who produce more pollution than the specified limit will be given a timely warning to rectify the car
